# Saved-Sorter-For-Reddit
A Python script that iterates through a user's saved posts on Reddit, downloading linked images as .png or .gif files.

If images are downloaded from a post, that post will be unsaved. All other posts will be ignored.

Currently supports directly linked images (such as those on i.redd.it, i.imgur.com, etc), Imgur pages with a single image on them, and Imgur albums. Likely supports directly linked images hosted on Artstation.
