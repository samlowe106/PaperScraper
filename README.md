# Paper Scraper for Reddit
A Python script that downloads wallpapers and other images from the saved category of the user's Reddit account.

Saved posts not linking directly to an image or imgur page will be ignored.

If images are downloaded from a post, that post will be unsaved. 

Currently supports directly linked images (such as those on i.redd.it, i.imgur.com, etc), Imgur pages with a single image on them, and Imgur albums. Likely supports directly linked images hosted on Artstation and similar sites.
